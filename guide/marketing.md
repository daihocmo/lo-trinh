## Lộ trình học

### Trước khi bắt đầu

1. Bạn cần chọn phần để bắt đầu 

- Nếu bạn thiên về viết lách thì có thể chọn **Content Marketing** hoặc **Copywriting**. 
- Nếu bạn thiên về phân tích thì có thể chọn **Search Ads** hoặc **PPC**.

Bạn không cần phải học tất các các phần, hãy học thật chắc phần mà bạn theo

Khi bạn đã quyết định nên học phần nào rồi, bạn cũng nên thiết lập một phương pháp học tập.

Tương tự như rất nhiều thứ khác, việc chỉ đọc về digital marketing sẽ không giúp bạn tiến xa, bạn cần thực sự ứng dụng những gì mình đã học, thực hành.

Bạn có thể chọn một trong 4 lựa chọn sau:


1. **Tạo môi trường học tập thử nghiệm**. Về cơ bản, bạn tạo một trang web cho một sản phẩm hoặc dịch vụ cơ bản (Thậm chí có thể là một Blog), và bắt đầu áp dụng bất cứ điều gì bạn đã học về Digital Marketing để có được khách hàng. Ngay cả khi bạn không có vốn, đây có thể là một trải nghiệm học tập hữu ích và bạn THỰC SỰ có thể bắt đầu với ngân sách bằng 0.

2. **Đi thực tập**. Sẽ khá là vấn đề nếu bạn đã có một công việc rồi. Nhưng này, tại sao không thử? Nếu cố gắng hết sức, bạn có thể sẽ được làm việc chính thức sau 6 tháng thực tập.

3. **Giúp tiếp thị cho một doanh nghiệp địa phương (local business) miễn phí**. Hãy tìm một doanh nghiệp mà bạn nghĩ rằng bạn có thể giúp đỡ trong khu vực của mình và liên hệ với họ.

4.  [Tạo một blog liên kết - affiliate blog](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/affiliate-marketing-blogs/299053/). Chọn một vị trí thích hợp, tạo một blog liên kết và bắt đầu sản xuất nội dung. Đặc biệt nếu bạn muốn học SEO hoặc tiếp thị nội dung (Content Marketing).

Và đây là những điều bạn ***KHÔNG NÊN LÀM***:

*Đọc một hoặc hai hướng dẫn, mua một khóa học, tạo trang web của riêng bạn, đăng lại khóa học lên đó và bắt đầu giả làm một chuyên gia tiếp thị.*

There are way too many people doing this as-is. Please stop! You're setting yourself up for failure.

You'd be surprised how many people we see on Facebook Ads groups asking, *"Hey guys, I closed my first client, now how the heck do I deliver on my promises?"*

...Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to learning some digital marketing!

### Những nội dung sẽ có trong hướng dẫn này

-   Content marketing
-   SEO
-   Search ads
-   PPC
-   Social media marketing
-   Copywriting
-   Email marketing
-   Web analytics

**Quick Note**

We took some liberties with splitting up some channels. For example, search ads fall under PPC, but since they require different skills/knowledge than most PPC channels, we split them up.

Finally, Copywriting is also NOT a digital marketing channel. However, it's an essential skill that helps with literally any other channel, so we decided to include it to the list.

Sue us.

## Learn Content Marketing

This one's our bread and butter.

Most traditional advertising channels are focused on directly selling a product. If you turn on the TV, you'll see a TON of ads for this product, or that product or service.

Content marketing is a form of indirect advertisement.

The idea here is, instead of directly pitching your product to your target audience, you create content (article, video, infographic, etc.) around the problem your product solves, and pitch that instead.

To make this a LOT clearer, here's a practical example.

Let's say you're a marketing agency that specializes in helping SaaS companies with their digital marketing (meta, right?).

Instead of directly running ads yelling "We help SaaS companies!" you create a mega-guide on the topic and advertise that.

...Which is what we did.

We created a mega-guide to [SaaS marketing](https://apollodigital.io/blog/saas-marketing) and promoted the hell out of it all over the web. This netted us around ~10,000+ traffic and 15+ leads in the first week, and we STILL get traffic to the piece, 2 months later.

We even posted it on [r/Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/) and got around 600 upboats.

Sweet, right?

Now, you're probably wondering, is this option better than just running ads to your service/product?

Yes, yes it is. Here's why:

1.  **It's free (ish).** The only resources it took was our time to write the post, edit it, and promote it. Ads, on the other hand, can be super expensive.

2.  **It builds your brand authority.** Who'd you trust with your marketing? A random guy that popped up on your Facebook newsfeed, or the guys that wrote the most comprehensive guide to SaaS marketing you've ever read? Exactly!

## Content Marketing Learning Path

Looking for the top resources to learn content marketing? Here is a mini-roadmap to get you going:

1.  **First, learn the basics.** You can find a ton of online courses or articles on this. Here are some of our favorites:

    2.  How [Mint grew to 1.5 million users](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-mint-grew/) (a big chunk of the credit goes to content marketing)

## Learn SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is another super popular digital marketing channel.

In a nutshell, SEO is the act of optimizing your web pages and content for Google so that your website pops up when people look up certain terms.

For example, let's say you're a project management software. Would it benefit you if you popped up #1 when people Google for your keyword?

Yes, yes it would. You'd be getting **highly qualified** leads for your software every day, for free, with ZERO ad spend.

Cool, right?

Here's what an SEO specialist does on a daily basis:

-   **Content Creation** - Create SEO content (or work with freelance writers)

-   **On-page SEO** - Make sure that all content on the blog is optimized for Google and interlinked to each other

-   **Technical SEO** - Make sure that the web dev team is following SEO best practices when working on the website

-   **SEO Strategy** - Doing keyword research and finding new web pages and content to create

-   **Link-building** - Conducting link-building (or supervising outreach specialists).

### Other SEO Resources

Looking for additional resources? Here are some of our favorite SEO blogs:

-   [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/blog)

-   [Moz](https://moz.com/blog)

-   [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/blog/)

-   [Gotch SEO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNEsahyXxNJvYNsMhru-UzQ)

-   [QuickSprout](https://www.quicksprout.com/blog/)

-   [Diggity Marketing](https://diggitymarketing.com/blog/)

Finally, a big part of SEO is using the right tools. Here are the ones we use every day (and love):

-   **All-in-one SEO tool.** Usually, that's either [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/lp/position-tracking-5/en/?ref=3446955498&refer_source=&utm_source=berush&utm_medium=promo&utm_campaign=link_lp:position_tracking_bmc)or Ahrefs. You're going to use this tool for literally anything - keyword research, content audit, technical audit, backlink analysis, etc.

-   **Scraping tool.** That could be URL Profiler or Screaming Frog, the best tool out there for content/technical audits.

-   **Rank checker tool.** We use the [MozBar extension](https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar), a super nifty tool for checking DA/PA.

-   **Content gap analysis tool.** For us, that's [Surfer SEO](https://surferseo.com/?fp_ref=nick20). This is mainly used for performing a gap analysis between your content and that of the competition. You can get a top-down view of what all the top-ranking articles have in common for any given keyword, and whether your content is up to par.

-   **Keyword research tool**. [UberSuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)is our #1 favorite here (and it's free-ish!).

## Learn Search Ads


Search ads are basically paid SEO.

Instead of waiting for months or years to rank on your keyword, you can start bidding on it instantaneously.

Seen the "Sponsored" results on top of your organic searches on Google?

Those are search ads.

Of course, unlike SEO, they're not free. You have to pay for each click you get.

The way search ads work is as follows. Each time someone Googles any keyword, Google holds a small auction.

Each advertiser on the keyword has a specific bid indicated on their account.

The one that bids the highest, gets the highest ranking.

Now given, this is a gross oversimplification, but that's the general idea behind it.

Usually, you'd use search ads if you are any type of business with inbound demand. For example...

-   Are you a bar in London, UK? You can advertise on "bars sofia," "best bars sofia," and "sofia nightlife."

-   Are you a legal firm in New York? You'd advertise on "law firm new york," "immigration law firm new york", "immigration lawyer new york", and so on.

-   Are you an online resume builder? You can advertise on "resume template," "resume builder", " how to make a resume", and so on.

Want to learn how to do search ads? Here are some of the best resources out there:

Search Ads Learning Path
------------------------

-   The #1 free resource on learning search ads is [the Google Academy](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=53-google-ads?use_local=true), and a close second is [Ad Espresso's guide](https://adespresso.com/guides/google-ads-beginners/).

-   If you're more of a fan of video content, there's Surfside's [PPC tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMvSWDtZGVo) or Isaac [Rudansky's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/AdVenturMediGroup/videos).

...And that's it.

You're probably wondering:

"*Wtf Nick, you mention 934 resources on SEO, but just 3 for search ads?"*

Yep. The thing w/ search ads is, it's easy to learn, hard to master. Going through Google's course on its own is enough to give you everything you need to know about search ads.

From then on, you need to apply what you learned into practice, and learn from there (and Google any problems/questions you might have).

Learn PPC
---------

PPC stands for "pay-per-click" and is an umbrella term for pretty much ALL online advertising types - Facebook ads, LinkedIn ads, Reddit ads, and all other social media ads.

In this case, we decided to focus on Facebook Ads, mainly for 2 reasons:

1.  It's the **most popular advertising channel** out there. There's a lot more demand for Facebook ad specialists, and you can get a lot more done with it

2.  If you learn how to do Facebook ads, all other channels **follow the same principles**

So, let's get right into it!

The way PPC works, in a nutshell, is as follows:

1.  You need to figure out the right targeting

2.  And you need to come up with the right ad creatives (both ad image and the ad copy)

Given, this is a LOT more complex than you'd think. The main responsibility for a PPC specialist is to test dozens of targeting options, mixed with dozens of ad creatives, and find what gets them the best results.

Learn Social Media Marketing
----------------------------

*"Wait, isn't social media marketing the same as PPC?"*

Technically, yes. For the purpose of this guide? Nope.

Social Media Marketing (SMM) as a whole is anything that has to do with marketing on social media (as the name suggests).

Yes, that includes PPC.

However, "Social Media Manager" and "Facebook Ad Expert" are 2 completely different things that require different skill-sets. Hence, we decided to split up PPC and SMM.

SMM, as defined for the purpose of this guide, includes:

1.  Creating engaging content on Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/LinkedIn

2.  Managing social media profiles of companies and replying to comments

3.  Organizing giveaways on social media

4.  Promoting company news or content on social media

If you've seen Wendy's social media account, that's a top-tier SMM marketing right there.

Now, how do you learn Social Media Marketing? Unlike most of the other guides we've mentioned, it's not nearly as step-by-step.

The general idea is:

1.  Master how specific social media platforms work. Follow people that are actively posting and have a dynamic followers group. Borrow what works best.

2.  Learn how to create engaging content (both written and visual).

3.  Post frequently and monitor the company's social media presence

So, accordingly, 90% of the work here is learning about each individual social media. Here are some of our favorite guides for that:

-   [Buffer's (general) guide to SMM](https://buffer.com/social-media-marketing)

-   [Facebook marketing](https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-marketing-tips/)

-   [Twitter marketing](https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-marketing/)

-   [Reddit marketing](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-market-reddit-guide-businesses/)

-   [Pinterest marketing](https://neilpatel.com/blog/ultimate-pinterest-marketing-guide/)

-   [How to use Canva to create awesome social media content](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-canva)

Learn Copywriting
-----------------

Yes, yes, copywriting is NOT exactly digital marketing.

It is, however, an ESSENTIAL skill for, well, just about any digital marketing channel we've mentioned so far.

-   Doing content marketing? You need to be able to write good copy.

-   SEO? Same thing. The more engaging your content, the more likely it is to rank.

-   Search ads & other PPC channels? Same. After all, no one's going to click your ad if the headline isn't compelling.

So, we decided to include copywriting in the guide.

For those of you that are new to digital marketing, copywriting means writing copy that sells. For example:

-   Landing page content

-   Sales pages

-   Email marketing copy

-   Ad copies (for all things PPC)

-   [Direct response sales letters](https://expresswriters.com/what-is-direct-response-copywriting/)

Unlike most of the other digital marketing channels we've covered, learning copywriting isn't as straightforward.

There's no step-by-step, read this, skim that, then read that, and BAM you're a copywriter!

Unfortunately, it takes a lot of reading, time, and practice. To get started, however, we recommend reading a handful of the following guides:

Copywriting Learning Path
-------------------------

-   [Copywriting 101 by QuickSprout](http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/10/07/the-definitive-guide-to-copywriting/). While nothing too exceptional, it's a good start.

Tl;dr, the guy created a course to teach his sister copywriting and shared it with the world on [r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur/)

-   [The Gary Halbert Letter](http://www.thegaryhalbertletter.com/)

Learn Email Marketing
---------------------

Email marketing is a digital marketing strategy that involves sending emails to prospects or existing customers.

The goal of every email marketing campaign is usually one of the following:

-   Turn email readers into customers

-   Upsell new products or services to existing customer base

-   Retain your reader base with interesting/informative content

And the To-Dos of an email marketer usually include:

-   Sending a weekly newsletter to blog readers

-   Notifying users/newsletter subscribers about new products or services

-   Figuring out how to increase blog reader-to-email subscriber conversions

-   Analyzing campaign performance and making adjustments as needed

-   A/B testing different emails/subject lines

Learn Web Analytics
-------------------

While analytics isn't exactly a channel, it's essential to know how to track your marketing campaigns.

Here is some basic stuff you HAVE TO know:

-   Learn Google Analytics (GA). W/ digital marketing, GA is your primary data hub. This is where you keep track of traffic, conversions, user flow, and whatever else. To learn how to use it, check out:

-   If you want to take your analytics game to the next level, you should also learn how to use Google Tag Manager (GTM). You can use GTM to set up conversion tracking by channel, and a ton of other stuff.

    -   [Google Tag Manager Course](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/5)

-   Planning on learning Analytics for SEO? Make sure to learn how to use the Search Console. That's your central hub to keep track of all your organic traffic.
