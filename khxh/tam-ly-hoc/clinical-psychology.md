# Clinical Psychology

If you go to the MIT OpenCourseWare website to the Psychology section, you will find pretty much everything I am about to list here (perhaps under slightly different titles). Also, some of the MIT OpenCourseWare pages do not come with videos, but I am confident it will be very easy to find most of these topics elsewhere online for free. Honestly, there is no way you'll be able to cover every topic in psychology in great detail. I'd suggest watching the general courses I am about to list here online, and then pick a few from the ones you like best and research those more. For example, I love philosophy of mind, so my research in the second half of my undergrad has been in cognitive psychology and psychophysics, with some clinical. Going by your interest in clinical, I'd say you will probably enjoy Abnormal, Social, and Forensic psych the most.

1.  Intro to Psychology (These courses cover a lot, so you'll probably find a good path to follow here, but I'll still layout what I recommend)

2.  Cognitive psychology

3.  Sensation & Perception (AKA Psychophysics)

4.  Abnormal Psychology (AKA Clinical psych)

5.  Brain & Behaviour

6.  Personality

7.  Social Psychology

8.  Developmental Psychology

9.  Psycholinguistics (AKA Psychology of Language)

10. Forensic psychology

11. Intro to Statistics

Hope this helps!

EDIT: I forgot to mention that you're probably not going to get any good introduction to psychoanalysis or psychodynamic theory in any of these psychology courses. If you're not super interested in psychoanalysis but still want an idea of what it is about, read Freud's "Outline of Psychoanalysis."
