# Archived
This curriculum has been archived.
No issues will be addressed and no pull requests merged in.
No changes will be made to the curriculum going forward.

## Reason
OSSU relies on a community of experts and learners to develop our curricula.
This is ongoing work, which requires evaluating new course offerings,
replacing courses that are discontinued, 
and responding to updated learning expectations of the field.

Unfortunately, OSSU no longer has volunteers to undertake that work for this curriculum.

## Unarchiving Criteria
This curriculum can be unarchived by a volunteer for curriculum maintainer.
Such a volunteer should contact the directors with:

1. A proposed curricular guide.
   A stranger who reads the guide should have a clear idea of how to evaluate if a course will fit in the curriculum.
   It is generally easier to make such judgements if there is one curricular guide, a reason that the OSSU CS curriculum changed from having two to one a number of years ago.
   [This open issue](https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics/issues/28) may be of assistance.
2. An explanation of personal expertise.
   The maintainer must have demonstrated more than familiarity with bioinformatics.
3. A pledge to be involved for at least 2 years.
   Maintaining the curriculum is a rewarding and long term commitment.
4. A transition plan for the end-of-tenure.
   The last job of a great leader is to establish another great leader in their place.
   What steps will you take when you decide to step down to ensure that another maintainer is prepared to take over?
