# On the Subject of Questions

> Questions are the driving force behind learning.

Without them, we would be stuck in perpetual confusion at worst, and with a surface level of knowledge at best.
Asking questions is essential to your continued development as an InfoSec specialist, as by not, you are compromising your understanding
and losing depth. We believe critical thinking, and the logical consequence of questions as a follow on, to be critical to your development.
While we have included a course on logic and critical thinking in the curriculum, we thought it apt to include a small appendature on its consequence.
Likely, you understand the importance of questions, or otherwise you would likely not be looking to get into this field. However, we want to foster the
skill of being able to ask the *right* questions in the *right* way, which is where a large number of people struggle. As such, we would like to refer you
to the excellent resource that is "[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)" by Eric Steven Raymond. This
site will hopefully guide you on how to ask the *right* questions and how to interpret the answers you may face. This reading is highly encouraged, as it
will not only ease your journey forward, but serve as a useful learning tool throughout.
