# Information Security - Great Readings, References, and Tools

This document is comprised of great books, articles, essays or other literature regarding information security or aspects related to it. Some here may reiterate material covered in your courses, but there may be others here that deal with other topics. Some of these materials are free or FOSS, but some may be paid, and are as such not necessarily mandatory.

Once you have made it through most of the curriculum, knowing whether a book is worth your time will become easier.
Or, if you are struggling in one of the courses, perhaps reading a book on the subject will help.

Another thing to note is the publisher No Starch Press. They have many great books, some of which will be included on this list. Please check them out on your own if you're interested in something that is not listed here.

As always, please feel free to submit PRs with new books to add. We'd love to hear from you!

## Introductory // General
Note, while some of the material, specifically in STCB4.0, may be a bit outdated, we still believe the book worth a read and advise researching what interests you. These books serve to spark an interest in a myriad of things, not make you an expert.
