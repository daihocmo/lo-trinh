# Information Security - Practical Application and Challenges

**Some individuals value sites that allow them to practice problems and gain hands on experience disconnected from a course.**

This is understandable, as it forces them to adapt their thinking and expand upon the foundations that they are being taught. Those seeking outside challenges must be able to effectively extrapolate from their foundations and learn to apply these extrapolations in meaningful ways.

**Others feel that its important not to get distracted by anxieties and puzzles.**

 We would like to extend a word to all beginners, as we know it can be tough, especially in a field such as information security where the knowledge is never-ending.

> Stay humble, but always seek new challenges. Humility is the key to learning, as you are never beyond correction, and thus, opening your mind. However, do not isolate yourself out of fear and claim it as humility. You must continually undertake new challenges if you hope to improve; seek out what you are not confident in, and apply yourself until you become more competent. It is the only path to success.

> You may want to make these new challenges practical, but we suggest that you make them another course. While there is something to be said for tenacity and an unrelenting pursuit towards competency in application, you must have at least a working understanding of what you seek to overcome. Without this, you are creating unnecessary hurdles in your approach. Utilize your resources to the maximum, and continually seek to expand your resources and knowledge so that as many of these hurdles are removed as possible.

> Be patient throughout. Unnecessarily rushing yourself creates gaps and frustration, which in tandem, may serve as motivation counter towards your objective. We highly encourage sticking with the curriculum, as it builds upon itself in a way set up to give you a base significant enough that you may effectively expand your understanding over time, rather than attempting to learn entirely new and foreign concepts in a sporadic way that just creates misunderstandings and knowledge gaps.

> Focus on the long term, not the short term. Your goal in starting this course should be to acquire a base and develop knowledge and your interests, not immediate mastery. Take the time to understand that while short term objectives are gratifying in their own way, they do not compare to the opportunities that long term objectives yield. We implore you to keep this in the back of your mind as you continue, not only through the courses, but throughout the duration of your journey in information security. 

We ask that you read the above and then consider how much time you wish to put into these resources:
- [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu)

> HackTheBox is a free and legal way to practice penetration testing skills across a myriad of difficulties. This resource is meant to enrich your understanding of how after your have learned the why; while attempting to learn the how and simply relying on that may yield early success, you will continually fail past a certain point if you have failed to grasp why these tools and methods are employed.

- [Pro/g/ramming Challenges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8ightfold/Pro-g-ramming-Challenges/main/pro_g_ramming.png)

> The /g/ board of 4chan has amassed a series of programming challenges, with various base difficulties and modifiers you can choose to do. These are excellent for developing your problem solving, critical thinking, and programming skills. They also provide an excellent opportunity to start your own GitHub, where you can put your attempts and open them to others.

- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)

> PicoCTF is a puzzle environment where users are able to attempt puzzles released in previous CTF competitions. Puzzles rely on a myriad of technical skills, and are a good way to apply and refine critical thinking skills. The site and competition ran alongside the puzzles is run by Carnegie Mellon University, an internationally renowned research institution particularly with regards to computing.
